I&#8217;ve gotten a few emails lately that go something like this:

> I&#8217;m just learning to code. Do you have any advice for how I can go from a beginner to getting my first job or internship?

I remember all to well not understanding the process of going from your first book / class / tutorial to actually getting a job. I really didn&#8217;t understand what it was that programmers did all day.

To simplify, let&#8217;s break the process down into three steps:

  1. **Learning** &#8211; Teaching yourself enough about programming to look for your first internship.
  2. **Coding **&#8211; Now that you&#8217;ve taught yourself a fair amount. It&#8217;s time to put in some hours _writing code_.
  3. **Applying** &#8211; Last but not least, you need to apply for internships and interview!

## Learning

  * Free learning sites
  * Meetup Groups
  * Blog

## Code

  * Make a personal website
  * Make something fun on github
  * Pick a suite of tools

## Apply

  * Be humble
  * Be excited
  * Be informed

Last but not least, I&#8217;ll leave you with an unedited email I sent to some random startup three years ago! ( I did not get the job )

>   I saw your craigslist posting and thought it looked delightful. The only problem is that I have almost no programming experience and am far from exceptional. I&#8217;m 22 years old and just getting into computer programming, Ruby is the first language I have started to learn. I was inquiring as to whether or not you folks would have any use for someone who is a quick learner and is very eager to learn. There is no need to trouble yourselves at all if this doesn&#8217;t sound convienent. I live in the Ann Arbor area, and if you all ever needed any help from someone like myself, I would be all to pleased to do pretty much whatever in exchange for the chance to learn from experienced programmers. As I said, if this isn&#8217;t a possibility, it&#8217;s not a problem at all. I just figured it was worth a shot.
