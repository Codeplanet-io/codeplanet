For those of you looking for a safe way to store user passwords in your Node.js application, look no further!

Introducing [bcrypt][2].

This Node package uses the [UNIX bcrypt library][3]Â first invented in 1999. It allows you to hash and encrypt sensitive data like user passwords before storing them in your database.

Let&#8217;s check out an example!

First you&#8217;ll want to install bcrypt and save it to your current project

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">npm install bcrypt --save</pre>

Then, inside your node app, create a salt and use the hashSync method to turn a plain text password into an encrypted hash.

<pre class="lang:js decode:true ">// Your node app

// Require the bcrypt package
var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

// Create a password salt
var salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync(10);

// Salt and hash password
var passwordToSave = bcrypt.hashSync(passwordFromUser, salt)

</pre>

Last, whenever you need to pull a password out of your database and check it against one the user entered ( like when they are trying to log back in! ) just do something like this:

<pre class="lang:js decode:true ">// Grab user from your database - this example uses MysQL
connection.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?",
    [usernameEnteredByUser],
    function(err, rows) {
        if (err) {
            return done(err);
        }

        if (bcrypt.hashSync(passwordEnteredByUser, salt) === rows[0].password) {
          // Yay, it worked!
        }
});</pre>

This should provide you an easy solution for storing and retrieving passwords in a way that is safe. Even if your databases are compromised, any attackers would only get access to the salted and hashed passwords.
