React.js is definitely the most popular JavaScript framework these days. I&#8217;ve spent a good amount of time using a lot of different resources to learn it and I thought it would be cool to share those with you!

## Egghead.io

<a href="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/egghead.jpeg" rel="attachment wp-att-915"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915" src="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/egghead.jpeg" alt="egghead" width="499" height="499" srcset="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/egghead.jpeg 499w, https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/egghead-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/egghead-300x300.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></a>

**Price &#8211;** $19.99 per month

**Description &#8211; **[Egghead.io][1] is an awesome video training site that offers a lot more than just React.js videos. They offer quite a few courses for free but their premium courses cover all things React. One of the unique offerings at Egghead is the (**free**) course on Redux by Dan Abramov.

## FrontEndMasters

**Price &#8211;** $39 per month

**Description &#8211;** [frontendmasters.com][2] has a unique take on video learning sites. Instead of the traditional screencast approach, Frontend Masters brings industry leaders out to their recording studio for a live, full day workshop. This means that for $39 a month, you get access to high quality workshops from all sorts of great developers! They only have one React video right now ( from one of the creators of React Router ) but a little birdie told me a brand new one is on the way!

## ReactJS Program

<a href="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/reactjsprogram.png" rel="attachment wp-att-918"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-918" src="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/reactjsprogram.png" alt="reactjsprogram" width="1500" height="329" /></a>

**Price &#8211; **Free for the fundamentals. Each extra course costs around $200.

**Description &#8211; **[ReactJS Program][3] is a brand new site launched by [Tyler McGinnis][4] that takes a project based, linear approach to teaching. That is to say you get a text and video version of each tutorial and each video / post builds on top of the last one while you get to build practical projects!

## React For Beginners

<a href="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/react-for-beginners.png" rel="attachment wp-att-922"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-922" src="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/react-for-beginners.png" alt="react-for-beginners" width="500" height="290" /></a>

**Price &#8211;** $47

**Description &#8211;** [React For Beginners][5] is truly a great resource, especially if you are in fact a beginner! [Wes][6] has years of experience teaching and it really shows as he takes a gentle and thoughtful approach to the entire ecosystem.

## The Official React Documentation

<a href="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/react.png" rel="attachment wp-att-924"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924" src="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/react.png" alt="react" width="400" height="400" /></a>

**Price &#8211;** Free

**Description &#8211;** I&#8217;m not normally the kind of person who learns well from reading raw documentation. However, I have to say that the React.js team really did a splendid job with their docs! Spend some time on their [official documentation page][7], I promise it&#8217;ll be worth it!

I hope that helps! Good luck on your journey to learning React.js!
