I just finished watching this [awesome video][1] from Google I/O in which [Paul Irish][2] and [Sam Saccone][3] profiled a few websites and talked about some great new Chrome DevTools features that are available now on [Chrome Canary][4]. If you want to watch the whole video, check it out below! Otherwise, here are the bullet points.

## Chrome DevTools Video



## 1. Network view within the Timeline tab

This great new addition allows you to get a better idea of what&#8217;s happening with your website. By allowing you to view network requests alongside your JS Profile and screen paint you can get a full picture of what is taking up time on your website!

## 2. Command Menu

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977" src="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-23-at-3.02.05-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-23 at 3.02.05 PM" width="538" height="380" />][6]

This might be my favorite addition! cmd+shift+p or ctrl+shift+p on Linux/Windows will open up the new command menu! This lets you fuzzy search for all the cool things that can be done with the Chrome DevTools. Never click again!

## 3. Mobile Interactions

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979" src="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-23-at-3.10.19-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-23 at 3.10.19 PM" width="604" height="250" />][7]

Also on the Timeline tab, now while using mobile emulation you can get an idea of what interactions (Fling, Scroll, Click) caused certain spikes in Paint or JS Profile!

## 4. CPU Throttling

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981" src="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-23-at-3.25.53-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-23 at 3.25.53 PM" width="569" height="202" />][8]

Similar to Network Throttling, this experiment allows you to simulate lower end devices which you should definitely be doing!
