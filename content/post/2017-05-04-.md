There are a few JavaScript methods that trip me up all the time. Two of those are Array.slice and Array.splice. Let&#8217;s cover what each one does and try to learn the differences of JavaScript slice vs splice!

Let&#8217;s begin with the [MDN][1] definitions:

## Array.slice

The `<strong>slice()</strong>` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from `begin` to `end` (`end` not included). The original array will not be modified.

<pre class="lang:js decode:true">const words = ["hello", "world", "code", "planet"]
const sliced = words.slice(1, 3)

console.log(words)
console.log(sliced)</pre>

## Array.splice

The `<strong>splice()</strong>` method changes the contents of an array by removing existing elements and/or adding new elements.

Splice can be used to insert or remove items from an array.

&nbsp;

## Slice vs Splice

The first, and most important distinction is thatÂ _splice modified the array and slice returns a new one_.
