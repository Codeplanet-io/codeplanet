I was listening to a presentation by [@aiwdesign](https://twitter.com/aiwdesign) the other day when she said something that caught me off guard. She said:

> If you want to run this application, all you need to do is install Chrome.

At first, my reaction was something like &#8220;What!? You have an app that doesn&#8217;t work on Firefox and IE!?&#8221;

But then it occurred to me that maybe this isn&#8217;t so ridiculous.

## Typical Software Requirements

Often times, when downloading client applications you&#8217;ll have to download an executable, run an installer and then open it. Sound familiar? It&#8217;s the exact same process you&#8217;ll need to install Chrome on virtually any computer.

### Â Think of Chrome as your application

I think this just requires a shift in perspective. We typically think of web applications as needing to be flexible enough to run on so many different pieces of software. Why not just have a disclaimer that the app your building isn&#8217;t so much a website as an application that has Chrome as a dependency.

## Not For Everyone

Obviously, you don&#8217;t want to build a typical web application and just disallow a large percentage of potential users for having a different browser preference than you.

Instead I&#8217;m suggesting that you can build replacements for client-side applications using web technologies and just require your user&#8217;s to install Chrome.
