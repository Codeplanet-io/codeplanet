Performance matters. There are a lot of great ways to make sure your website speed is good enough to not have a negative affect on your user base. These are my favorite tools for performing a website speed test.

## 1. Google Pagespeed Insights

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1013" src="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-19-at-12.24.40-PM.png" alt="Website Speed Test with Google Pagespeed Insights" width="1277" height="700" />](https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-19-at-12.24.40-PM.png)

I think it&#8217;s a pretty good idea to listen to listen to the company you most want to impress when it comes to performance. Not only that but the tool really does give excellent advice!

This tool will give you in-depth advice for both desktop and mobile and breaks everything down into the categories ofÂ **speed** andÂ **user experience**.

The only caveat with this tool is that sometimes you just can&#8217;t fix something they flag as a problem. For example, thereÂ will be timesÂ **you need to put JavaScript or CSS in the head tag**. So take the advice with a grain of salt! If you can fix the problem, great! Otherwise, move on.

## 2. Pingdom website speed test

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018" src="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-19-at-12.37.42-PM.png" alt="pingdom speed test" width="1280" height="699" />](https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-19-at-12.37.42-PM.png)

This tool is great because it gives you a neat little summary at the top. It&#8217;s a great place to start when you just want to get an idea of what&#8217;s going on but aren&#8217;t ready to deep dive into web performance.

## 3. GTmetrix

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023" src="https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-19-at-12.44.37-PM.png" alt="GTmetrix" width="1278" height="700" />](https://codeplanet.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-19-at-12.44.37-PM.png)

GTmetrix is awesome because it providesÂ **a ton** of information! It not only crawls your website, but it pulls in more information from PageSpeed and YSlow to give you a full picture of your website&#8217;s performance.

My only advice here is to make sure you go after the low hanging fruit. Don&#8217;t get stuck in the weeds troubleshooting minor issues, fix what you can easily and move on!

## Some cool statistics I like

The [W3 Total Cache FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/faq/) has some really motivating statistics around web performance. I just wanted to dump them here for you all to see ðŸ™‚

> Google.com: **+500 ms** (speed decrease) -> **-20% traffic loss**
> 
> Yahoo.com: **+400 ms** (speed decrease) -> **-5-9% full-page traffic loss** (visitor left before the page finished loading)
> 
> Amazon.com: **+100 ms** (speed decrease) -> **-1% sales loss**
